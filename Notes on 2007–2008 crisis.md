## Relationship with Crime

- Of the 100 agencies who linked crime rises to the economic crisis, 39 percent said they had seen an increase in **robberies**, 32 percent an uptick in **burglaries** and 40 percent an increase in **thefts from vehicles**.

    - Crimes types likely to increase during recession:
        - Robbery
        - Burglary
        - Theft
        - Car Theft
        - Homicide?
- the evidence shows that crime is linked to the economic climate. Such findings are consistent with criminal motivation theory, which suggests that economic stress causes an increase in criminal behaviour.
